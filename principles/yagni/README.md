# YAGNI

* What the fuck is this YAGNI?
* This is important?
* This cost to many money for project?

> Yagni originally is an acronym that stands for "You Aren't Gonna Need
It". It is a mantra from ExtremeProgramming that's often used generally
in agile software teams. It's a statement that some capability we
presume our software needs in the future should not be built now because
"you aren't gonna need it".
