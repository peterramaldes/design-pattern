# Design Pattern's

![Types of Design Patterns](./imgs/types-of-design-patterns.jpeg "Types of Design Patterns")

## Samples

### Creational

**Creational pattern** design patterns provide ways to create objects while
hiding the creation logic, instead of instantiating objects directly using the
new operator. This gives the program more flexibility in deciding which objects
need to be created for a given use case.

1. [Singleton](./creational/singleton/)
2. [Factory](./creational/factory-method/)
3. [Abstract Factory](./creational/abstract-factory/)

### Structural

**Structural pattern** deals with class and objects composition. The concept of
inheritance is used to compose interfaces and define ways to compose objects to
obtain new functionality.

6. [Adapter](./structural/adapter/)

### Behavioral

**Behavioral pattern** are specifically concerned with communication between
objects.

23. [Command](./behavioral/command/)

## Motivation

### Benefits

Design Pattern have two major benefits:

1. Provide a way to solve issues related to software development using a
   proven solution. The solution facilities the development of highly
   cohesive modules and minimal coupling. They isolate the variability
   that may exist in the system requirements, making the overall system
   easier to understand and maintain
1. Make communication between designers more efficient. Software
   professionals can immediately picture the high level design in their
   heads when they refer the name of the pattern used to solve a
   particular issue when discussing system design
