* [Factory Method](./patterns/factory-method/)

## Motivation

### Benefits

Design Pattern have two major benefits:

1. Provide a way to solve issues related to software development using a
   proven solution. The solution facilities the development of highly
   cohesive modules and minimal coupling. They isolate the variability
   that may exist in the system requirements, making the overall system
   easier to understand and maintain
1. Make communication between designers more efficient. Software
   professionals can immediately picture the high level design in their
   heads when they refer the name of the pattern used to solve a
   particular issue when discussing system design
